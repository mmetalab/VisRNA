# Abstract
# Motivation: 
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes a significant proportion of lung cancer cases and is a leading global cause of death. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a potent tool for elucidating disrupted genes and mechanisms at the single-cell level, offering insights into discovering therapeutic targets for NSCLC.
# Results: 
This study introduced VisRNA, a Python-based visualization web application tailored for efficient statistical and functional analysis using scRNA-seq data. VisRNA employs machine learning for multiple-dimensionality reduction techniques for scRNA-seq data and subsequent automatic cell-type annotation. By analyzing the differentially expressed genes among different cell clusters, VisRNA identified putative therapeutic targets and drug candidates, ranked by the results of the molecular docking simulation. VisRNA integrated NSCLC scRNA-seq data, uncovering 14 cell types with significantly differentially expressed genes. Notably, the potential drug dihydroergotamine emerged, exhibiting the lowest binding affinity for different targets across multiple cell types, indicating potential therapeutic targets and drug candidates for NSCLC.
